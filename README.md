"Wait, didn't your location status say 'I'm glad to say i LOVE ON hermithill' instead of saying 'LIVE in'??? You even misspelled instead by removing the n!!!! you are so bad at spelling, me!!!" ok i get it, me, bUT THATS NO EXCUSE TO BE BASHING ME ABOUT IT!!!!! I JUST TYPE FAST AND i know what youre thinking "you're too carless to look back at things again!!" and i admit i AM often carless, and you guys r too!!! dont deny it you may have misspelled your displayname and havent noticed it for more than 5 months!!!!! Thats definitelly NOT an original experience....... right....?????
